# CROPSCITY
An urban farmer’s guide to growing plants in the city.

## Motivation
Gardening can be a tricky hobby to keep in the city. Environmental factors, such as climate or growing space, need to be considered and responded to in rather creative ways. Cropscity provides an extensive list of plants and vegetables, each presented with its own detailed profile containing visual characteristics and growing conditions. Profiles also include Q&A sections for users to inquire about growing specific plants.
